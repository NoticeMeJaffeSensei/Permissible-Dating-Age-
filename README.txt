### Permissible Dating Age

This is a Java application program with a simple User Interface (UI) that 
utilizes an MVC framework. This program uses a simple formula to calculate the
parameters of the permissible dating age while also rounding off the values
calculated from the formula to give a clear dating range. There are special 
flavor texts included when the user's lover's age is not within the boundaries
of the permissible dating age.

Hope you enjoy!
